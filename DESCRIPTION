Description: A not uncommon task for quants is to create `waterfall charts'. There seems to be no simple way to do this in ggplot2 currently. This package contains a single function (waterfall) that simply draws a waterfall chart in a ggplot2 object. Some flexibility is provided, though often the object created will need to be modified through ggplot2's theme.
